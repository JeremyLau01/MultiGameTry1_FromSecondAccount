# MultiGameTry1
I created this game and uploaded it to my second account, then imported the project into this account, my main account.
It is a basic 2D game where you can move around and jump with the WSAD keys. You can double jump if you press "W" twice. If you catch a weapon, you can use your mouse to fire it.
There are still some glitches when multiple people are online, but it works well when only one person is logged in. <br><br>Maximum of four players allowed (If four players are playing, you will be unable to join/play the game. You will see the "level" but will not see green square character appear)<br><br>
