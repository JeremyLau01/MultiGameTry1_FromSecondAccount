# MultiGameTry1
I created this game and uploaded it to my second account, then imported the project into this account, my main account.
It is a basic 2D game where you can move around and jump with the WSAD keys. You can double jump if you press "W" twice. If you catch a weapon, you can use your mouse to fire it.
There are still some glitches when multiple people are online, but it works well when only one person is logged in. Maximum of four players allowed.
